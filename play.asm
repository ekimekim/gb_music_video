SECTION "Main video update loop", ROM0

; NOTE: These routines are heavily optimised, and inlined for efficiency.
; We make heavy use of one-use macros just as a means of code organization.


; High-level overview of each line:
;	(starting in prev line, or in vblank for first line)
;	prepare new volume pair. save second volume to a reg
;	audio sample switchover occurs. write first volume.
;	write new audio sample pair, check for bank switch, etc
;	prepare regs for palette load, including loading palette group addr
;	hblank begins.
;	perform first half(ish) of palette load, until time for audio sample switchover
;	audio sample switchover occurs. write second volume.
;	perform second half of palette load.
;	hblank critical section over.
;	check if this is the last line, break if so
;	pad total loop time out to 228 cycles
;	loop
;	on break: go into vblank.
;
; High-level overview of vblank, without audio updates:
;	(starting while writing last line of prev frame)
;	load next frame to display
;	h-blank of last line begins (VRAM is writable from here to end of vblank)
;	Write 19 rows (38 * 16 bytes) of tile indexes to background map bank 0 using DMA
;	Write 19 rows (38 * 16 bytes) of tile flags to background map bank 1 using DMA
;	Write scroll values to ScrollX/ScrollY
;	Execute tile data load orders
;	Set up for line loop
