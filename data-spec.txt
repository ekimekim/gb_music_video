NOTE: in all cases, when showing bits within a byte, the left-most bit is the most signifigant.
	For example, "x0000000" means 128 when x = 1, or 0 when x = 0.

audio data:
	List of samples, played at 18396Hz.
	Samples are grouped into pairs:
		0vvv0VVV
		xxxxXXXX
	where vvv, xxxx is the first sample, and VVV, XXXX is the second.
	Wave data values = (vvv+1) * (xxxx - 7.5)

palette group data:
	List of palette groups, 32 bytes each.
	Palette groups are referred to by their index into this list.
	This is called the *palette group index* and is a 2-byte value.
	A palette group is a list of 4 palettes which are used as a set,
	ie. you specify the entire palette group to be loaded into memory for a particular line.
	Each palette within the group is a list of 4 colors.
	Each color is a 2-byte value:
		gggrrrrr 0bbbbbGG
	where red is rrrrr, blue is bbbbb, and green is GGggg.
	ie. it's like this but little-endian:
		0bbb bbgg gggr rrrr
	Values are not linear to brightness of each color.
	Maps to standard RGB32 as follows:
		r = (13r + 2g + b)/2
		g = 6g + 2b
		b = (3r + 2g + 11b)/2
	ie. a value of (31, 0, 0) is actually color #c9002e.

rom tile data:
	List of tiles, 16 bytes each.
	Tiles are referred to by their index into this list.
	This is called the *tile rom index* and is a 2-byte value.
	Tiles are as per normal gameboy tile format, ie:
		Each row of 8 pixels is defined by two bytes.
		The first byte defines the lower bits of the pixel values,
		and the second byte defines the upper bits.
		eg. 01010101 00110011 maps to pixel values 01230123

vram tile data:
	This is standard GB stuff. There are two banks of 256 tiles each.
	These tiles are indexed by both bank and index.
	These are known as *tile vram bank* and *tile vram index*
	and are 1-byte values each.
	The format is the same as rom tile data.

frame data:
	List of frames, 2048 bytes each.
	Frames are referred to by their index into this list.
	This is called the *frame index*.
	Each frame consists of:
		19 rows of tile vram indexes:
			Each row consists of 21 tile vram indexes,
			followed by 11 bytes of padding.
		19 rows of tile flag values:
			Each row consists of 21 tile flag values,
			followed by 11 bytes of padding.
			Tile flag are one byte:
				0vh0bppp
				where v and h are flags saying if the tile should be vertically or horizontally flipped,
				b is the tile vram bank of the tile to display,
				and ppp is the color palette number to use.
		144 palette changes:
			Before each line, 4 palettes are written.
			On even lines (0, 2, etc), palettes 0-3 are overwritten.
			On odd lines (1, 3, etc), palettes 4-7 are overwritten.
			Each palette change consists of a palette group index,
			referring to the 4 new palette values to be written.
		1 byte of scroll values:
			0yyy0xxx
			where yyy is scroll y value, and xxx is scroll x value.
			This allows you to scroll up to just under one tile in either axis, exposing the
			19th row or 21st column.
		One byte indicating length of the following load order list, between 0 and 25.
		List of load orders:
			A load order happens before the frame and indicates what tiles should be loaded into
			VRAM. It consists of two parts:
				The source index:
					The tile rom index of the first tile to copy.
				The destination bank:
					Either 0 or 1, the tile vram bank to load the tiles into
				The destination index:
					The tile vram index of the first index to copy into
				Length:
					How many tiles to copy. Up to 128.
			So, for example, if you wanted to copy tiles 5-19 from ROM into VRAM bank 0 indexes 30-44,
			and tiles 300-301 from ROM into VRAM bank 1 indexes 254-255, you would do this:
				2 (two load orders to do)
				0, 5 (first source starts at 5)
				0, 30 (dest bank 0, index starts at 30)
				15 (fifteen tiles to copy)
				1, 44 (second source starts at 300)
				1, 254 (dest bank 1, index starts at 254)
				2 (two tiles to copy)
			NOTE: There is a timing limit here based on both the number of load orders and
			the number of tiles. The total number of tiles + the number of load orders must be <= 51.
			For example, you can do 50 tiles in one load order,
			or 49 spread over two, or 48 spread over three, etc,
			down to 25 load orders of 1 tile each.
		The remaining bytes up to 2048 are unused padding
			You can calculate how many bytes to use as: 542 - <number of load orders> * 5
