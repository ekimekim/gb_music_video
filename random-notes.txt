all cycles in fast cycles

audio:
	play ch3 at 2097152/114 = ~18396Hz = one sample per 114 cycles
	one line is 228 cycles so it plays one byte (two samples) every line.
	When each sample is played, it must be modulated
	using a combination of the available volume controls:
		The actual value, between 0 and 15
		The master volume for each output channel, between 0 and 7
	Do they combine linearly? ie. 3/16 actual * 3/8 master = 9/128?

	So upkeep for audio is volume adjust every half a line and new sample
	every line, including during vblank (vblank is 10 lines).

palettes:
	Update palettes each line during hblank or OAM search.
	Total time: at most 142 cycles, less if sprites or window present on prev line.
	But we need to spend probably 6 cycles of that updating the audio volume at the correct time.
	So actual limit is 136.
	We only need to update background palettes.
	Quick time estimate:
		ld A, [HL+]
		ld [C], A
		is 4 cycles/byte
		(abusing SP isn't any better)
		so we have 256 cycles for an entire palette swap. too long.

		We can update half of the palettes each cycle.

	Palette data compression:
		Instead of storing a whole 4 palettes for each line change,
		we store 4x 2 bytes indicating a palette number. Then we have a seperate list of
		all unique palettes used by the program.
		This would be loaded into RAM.

tile map:
	OLD:
		Using DMA, we can update 16 bytes/line for non-vblank period at minimal cost
		of 16 cycles/hblank. This gives us 16 * 144 = 2304 bytes per frame, which is easily
		enough to rewrite entire on-screen tile map (18 rows * 2 banks = 1152 bytes because of how rows have
		to be grouped).
		The DMA setup will be annoying, because we need to finish early rows in both banks before
		we reach them. So our best bet is row 1 bank 0, row 1 bank 1, row 2 bank 0, etc. so each DMA
		is individual, not automatic. That accounts for 18 rows * 2 banks * 2 rounds/row * 1 line/round
		= 72 lines.
	NEW:
		We can't afford any DMA during hblank as we simply can't spare 16 whole cycles.
		Instead, we'll have to update the map during vblank.
		vblank lasts 2280 cycles, of which we have 10 long audio updates and 10 short ones.
		Short ones are 3 cycles:
			ld A, R
			ld [C], A
		Long ones will need to load next sample, next pair of vols (put the latter in R)...
		estimate 20 cycles.
		Then left over time is:
			2280 - 20*10 - 4*10 = 2040
		We need to use 1152 of this to copy background map, leaving 888.

tile data:
	OLD:
		During vblank, we can spend most of our time in DMA but need to pause to upkeep audio 2-3 times.
		Let's assume it takes ~16 cycles each time. That leaves us with:
		2280 - 16*3 = 2232
		which rounds down to 139 rounds, which is 139 tiles written. Round down to 128 to give us
		leeway and make it replacing a quarter of tiles per frame.
	NEW:
		We have 888 cycles to work with. Assume it takes ~16 cycles to set up DMA, let's aim
		for 50 tiles able to be DMA'd in one go, or less (with one tile less per independent DMA).
		This leaves us with 88 cycles of slack just in case.

	Compression:
		Instead of 50 every frame (huge amount of rom!), we allow frame data to specify a load
		of up to 50 tiles from ROM, into an arbitrary tile area.
		eg. "load N tiles from (rom bank, offset) to (vram bank, offset)"
		Could allow multiple runs. Would need to validate to ensure it doesn't run over time.

left over cycles:
	Not counting the slack at the end of each vblank, we have 86 cycles/line.
	As above, let's estimate 20 of those must be spent on audio upkeep.
	Then the total time we have to:
		* Decide the next frame
		* Decode the next frame into RAM
		* Anything else
	is 66*144 = 9504/frame

ROM usage:
	audio: ~1 bytes/sample * 18396 samples/sec = 18396b/sec
	In one bank, we can hold 16384b / 18396b/sec = ~0.89sec
	This is 67.37 banks/min. 3min audio: 202 banks. 5min audio: 336 banks.

	tile data: 1024 tiles/bank. Probably only need 1-2 banks.

	palette data: 2048 palettes/bank. Probably only need 1 bank.

	tile and palette map:
		Ideally packed, each frame is:
			21*19 tiles * 2b/tile + 4 palettes/line * 2b/palette * 144 lines = 798b + 1152b = 1950b
		which can fit 4 frames/bank.
		However, to facilitate DMA, each row needs to have 11b of junk on the end.
		With junk included:
			32*19 tiles * 2b/tile = 1216 + previous for palette = 2368 which is only 3 frames/bank.
		So we need to pack the frame data somehow.
		Option 1: copy into RAM.
			Takes ~6 cycles/byte * 798b = 4788.
			We have ~9k of cycle time left, so this is feasible.
		Option 2: stick palettes into unused part
			This makes perfect use of the space, and doesn't add much complexity/time to
			the existing palette decompression routine. This is a better option.
			Let's say the first set of 4 palettes and the first one of the next set go in there.
			This junk will be written to VRAM but it doesn't matter.
			This still leaves 1 byte/line unused which costs us 19 bytes, but that'll fit.
			Except we have one more row than set of 8 lines due to scrolling,
			so this all gets fucked up. Simpler to go with option 1.
		Also +1 byte which holds scroll values, 0-7 in each direction.
		Also a list of tile load orders, a few bytes each.

	So we can pack 8 frames in a bank, so with ~200 banks we have ~1600 unique frames.

	other stuff:
		flow control deciding what frames to show and when, loops, etc. unlikely to need a whole
		bank.

ALTERNATE:
audio: as above
tile data:
	By using DMA for all of vblank (being careful to break in time for audio):
		2280 - ~16*10 in overhead of audio handling = 2120
	and two rounds of DMA during each h-blank + OAM, leaving 110 cycles:
		32 * 144 = 4608
	this gives us 6728 bytes to write.
	We only need to write 18*20*16 = 5760 to write a new tile data for every visible tile.
	So we can re-write every tile on screen over the course of a frame
	(with the top half of screen in vram bank 0 and the bottom in bank 1). With room to spare.
	But we can't do it while only doing one round of DMA per line (ie. using hblank DMA),
	that only gives us 4424. So we can only write 3 palettes per line.

	Rejected as not interesting enough :P
